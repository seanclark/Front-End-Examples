      <h2>Why Trap Neuter and Return (TNR) is a Good Idea...Even If Cats are Not Your Thing</h2>
      <div class="content">Trap Neuter and Return is an often misunderstood subject. So here is an overview of  the benefits of TNR and how it helps reduce the population in a humane way. A misconception is that removing cats from an overpopulated area will keep the population down.

            All this does is simply open up the territory for new cats to come in an breed. However, if you spay and neuter you will prevent further breeding and keep the population under control. Granted not everyone is able to do this. Rescue groups and other motivated individuals can handle it well and get reduced rates on the surgeries if the animals are ferals.</div>

      <div class="content">The Vet can 'ear-tip' the cats that are fixed so it is known which ones are done (see photo). There are many other point we could touch on with this subject but we'll keep it short and sweet for now. Trap neuter and return the cats and you will see a huge difference to what you thought was an insurmountable problem.</div>
