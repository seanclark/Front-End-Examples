        <h2>How to Clip Your Cat's Nails...Without Hurting Them</h2>
           <div class="content">Lets get one thing straight first...cats don't like having their nails cut. But we won't be talking about how to keep your fluffy feline from flipping out while you do it. I want to show you the proper way to clip their nails so you don't cause them injury.
            Whether you use specialized clippers for pet nails or a toe nail clipper for humans, the principle is the same.

            </div>
          <div class="content">When looking at your cat's nail you will see pink colored tissue called 'quick' inside of the nail. The idea is to clip the tip of the nail so you don't go down to the pink. Leave enough room so you are not too close. There may be an exact amount to leave (I've seen 3mm) but I just try to keep it safe.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="content">So just repeat this for each nail and you're good to go. Again all of this depends a lot on your cat's temperament whether he/she will let you do it.
            Although it does take some practice, you can cut your cat's nails successfully and keep them (and you) happy!</div>
