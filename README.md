# Front-End-Examples
Listed are various examples and screenshots of web development projects I have completed. I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, Font Awesome, as well as Angular to develop these sites and pages. More recently I have been working with React Js.
Please see the folder called "Screenshots" which contains visual examples of my work.
