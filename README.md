# Front-End-Examples
Various examples of front end web development projects I have completed. I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, Font Awesome, and other technologies to develop these sites and pages.
I have included a folder called screenshots that contains visual examples of my work.
